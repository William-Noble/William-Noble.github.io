                    <p class="sectionContent">
                        Word Guess is a hangman style game created using python.
                        The game required users to enter a few criteria before it could start, specifically the word length and the number of guesses available to the user.
                        Step one was for a random word matching the word length to be selected from the local word database (an array with a bunch of words in it).
                        The game would then allow the user to guess letters 1 at a time revealing the location of the letter in the word on every correct guess.
                        A list of every guess is provided along with a counter of the remaining number of guesses the user has available.
                        Upon guessing the entire word or running out of guesses the game either returns a win or a fail and prompts the user to replay.

                    <p class="sectionContent">
                        The Basic Calculator was not very complicated, it took only 3 inputs to make mathematical calculations.
                        This project was designed early into my learning of python and held several inefficiencies, namely, it lacked error handling in most cases and used a long if/elif chain to determine the input.
                        Calculators as basic as this will never be used in a situation that requires a significant amount of computing power therefore, in this case, the buggy CPU intensive code is unlikely to have any measurable impact.

                    <p class="sectionContent">
                        For this project I was given a list of simple python programming assignments to program.
                        <br><br>
                        The first assignment was to create a function that determined if a number was a prime number.
                        using the basic approach I created a for loop that iterated through every number from 2 to n/2 and used the modulus (%) operator to find if n was divisible.
                        <br><br>
                        Secondly, find the sum of all positive numbers from 0 to n.
                        This was a pretty simple task for a for loop but to maximize efficiency I employed the sum=n(n+1)/2 formula developed by Guass.
                        <br><br>
                        The third assignment was to create a game where the user had to guess a number within a range.
                        For this I had to check whether the user input was greater than, less than or equal to the correct number.
                        From here I could provide feedback that the user could use to make their next guess.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, The last game simply had users roll a dice and whichever user rolled a 6 first won.
                        This was a very simple task only requiring a while loop to keep play going until a 6 was rolled.
                        This was also a very boring game.

                        In this program I had a basic UI where the user could input the names of students and how well they did on a test.
                        When the user enters the last student score the program returns information on the class average.

                        When users open this program they are prompted to select one of the following options:

                        (4) Exit the program
                        <br>
                        After the user selects an option the appropriate function is called.
                        All progress is saved in a 2d array which can be expanded to accommodate any data the user wishes to enter.
